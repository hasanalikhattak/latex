{"name":"Latex Related work","tagline":"I will be updating this with my latex work or my research interests (no promised though)","body":"These instructions have been updated for Ubuntu 14.04 and TeX Live 2014, they will probably work on most Ubuntu/Debian distributions.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nInstalling \"vanilla\" TeX Live is not as hard as you think. Things you will need:\r\n\r\n* An internet connection.\r\n* About 4 GiB of free space (2 GiB if not installing documentation).\r\n* Root (`sudo`) powers.\r\n\r\nAlso: the instructions are meant for the terminal. If you're uncomfortable with that you can probably still install the `texlive-full` package from the Software center.\r\n\r\nTeX Live Installer\r\n------------------\r\nFirst the official installer needs to be downloaded with the following commands:\r\n\r\n    wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl-unx.tar.gz\r\n    tar -xzf install-tl-unx.tar.gz\r\n    cd install-tl-20140618\r\n    \r\nNote that the `install-tl-20140618` folder may be named differently. You can probably type `install-tl` and then press <kbd>tab</kbd> to autocomplete the folder name.\r\n\r\nNow the installation can begin, run:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./install-tl\r\n    \r\nThis will start the installer. You can change all kind of options here, most of the time the default options are correct. In some cases changing the options can, of course, be helpful. Not installing the *doc* and *source* trees will save you a lot (1.8 GiB, 50%) of disk space. This comes with the downside of having to look up documentation online, instead of locally.\r\nIf you want to reduce disk space further you can also change the installation *scheme* or *collections*, but this will result in not having certain packages installed by default. You can, however, install them later through the TeX live manager.\r\n\r\nPress <kbd>i</kbd> to start installation. Depending on your internet connection this may take a long time.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, the installation is interrupted it can probably be resumed by running the installer again. This will prompt you to continue the installation. If you want to start the installation from the beginning it's probably wise to remove the installed elements:\r\n\r\n    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2014\r\n\r\nFinalising the installation\r\n---------------------------\r\nIf the installation completes successfully you will want to make sure your operating system can find it. This can be done by creating a *symbolic link*:\r\n\r\n    sudo ln -s /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/* /opt/texbin\r\n    \r\n(Note: there should only be one subdirectory in `/usr/local/texlive/2014/bin`.)\r\n\r\nNow you'll have to add `/opt/texbin` to your `$PATH` variable. This can be done by editing `/etc/environment`:\r\n\r\n    gksudo gedit /etc/environment\r\n\r\nYou'll see something like:\r\n\r\n    PATH=\"/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\r\n\r\nYou can change this to:\r\n\r\n    PATH=\"/opt/texbin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\"\r\n\r\nNow you'll need to logout and login again for the changes to take effect.\r\nNow start Terminal again and run:\r\n\r\n    which tex\r\n\r\nThis should show the following:\r\n\r\n    /opt/texbin/tex\r\n\r\nFake packages\r\n-------------\r\nNow TeX Live works, but it's also necessary to make Ubuntu think you've installed TeX Live. This can be done with the `equivs` package:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install equivs --no-install-recommends\r\n    mkdir /tmp/tl-equivs && cd /tmp/tl-equivs\r\n    equivs-control texlive-local\r\n\r\nFirst you'll have to edit `texlive-local`. A good example for TeX Live 2014 can be found [here][10].\r\n\r\n    gedit texlive-local\r\n\r\nNow you can build the package and install it:\r\n\r\n    equivs-build texlive-local\r\n    sudo dpkg -i texlive-local_2014-1_all.deb\r\n\r\nAfter this installing `texworks` through the package maintainer won't install TeX Live again.\r\n\r\nFonts\r\n-----\r\nIf you want to install all OpenType and TrueType fonts so you can use them in other programs as well, you'll have to add the TeX Live fonts to the system configuration:\r\n\r\n    sudo cp $(kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFSYSVAR)/fonts/conf/texlive-fontconfig.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf\r\n    gksudo gedit /etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf\r\n\r\nRemove the line containing `type1` and save. Now run:\r\n\r\n    sudo fc-cache -fsv\r\n\r\nUpdating\r\n========\r\nYou can now update TeX Live though the TeX Live Manager by running:\r\n\r\n    sudo /opt/texbin/tlmgr --gui\r\n\r\nIt might complain about missing 'Tk', this can be solved by installing `perl-tk`:\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install perl-tk --no-install-recommends\r\n\r\nLauncher\r\n--------\r\nYou can also create a launcher for Unity:\r\n\r\n    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications\r\n    gedit ~/.local/share/applications/tlmgr.desktop\r\n\r\nPaste the following:\r\n\r\n    [Desktop Entry]\r\n    Version=1.0\r\n    Name=TeX Live Manager\r\n    Comment=Manage TeX Live packages\r\n    GenericName=Package Manager\r\n    Exec=gksu -d -S -D \"TeX Live Manager\" '/opt/texbin/tlmgr -gui'\r\n    Terminal=false\r\n    Type=Application\r\n    Icon=system-software-update\r\n    \r\nOnce again you'll need to logout and login again for the changes to take effect.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the next TeX Live\r\n==============================\r\nTo upgrade you need to download and run the installer again. Afterwards you need to replace the symbolic link:\r\n\r\n    sudo ln -sf /usr/local/texlive/2014/bin/* /opt/texbin\r\n    \r\nIt might also be a good idea to run the font section again. You can remove the old distribution by running:\r\n\r\n    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/texlive/2013\r\n\r\nUninstalling TeX Live\r\n=====================\r\nTo remove TeX Live completely you need to undo everything you've done:\r\n\r\n* Remove the `/opt/texbin` symbolic link.\r\n* Remove `/opt/texbin` from the system path.\r\n* Remove `/etc/fonts/conf.d/09-texlive.conf` and update font cache.\r\n* Remove `/usr/local/texlive`.\r\n* Remove the package created with `equivs` (`sudo apt-get purge texlive-local`).\r\n\r\nReferences and sources\r\n======================\r\n* [TeX Live Debian guide][1]\r\n* [TeX Live Quick install][2]\r\n* [Enrico Gregorio's article for TUGboat][3]\r\n\r\n  \r\n  [1]: http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html#vanilla\r\n  [2]: http://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html\r\n  [3]: http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-1/tb100gregorio.pdf\r\n  [10]: http://www.tug.org/texlive/files/debian-equivs-2014-ex.txt","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
